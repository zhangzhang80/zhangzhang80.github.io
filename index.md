## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="zhangzhang.jpg">

I received the PhD degree from [National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition (NLPR)](http://nlpr.ia.ac.cn), [Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA)](http://www.ia.ac.cn/) in 2009 under the supervision of [Prof. Tieniu Tan](http://cripac.ia.ac.cn/CN/column/item83.shtml). From 2009 to 2010, I was a research fellow working with [Prof. Dacheng Tao](https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/cris/rp/rp02343) at the School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University (NTU). In September 2010, I joined the NLPR, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences(CASIA). In 2019, I worked as a visiting researcher under the direction of [Prof. Song-Chun Zhu](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~sczhu/) at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Now, I am an Associate Professor at the [New Laboratory of Pattern Recognition (NLPR)](http://cripac.ia.ac.cn/) and [State Key Laboratory of Multimodal Artificial Intelligence Systems(MAIS)](https://mais.ia.ac.cn/), CASIA.

## Research Interests

My research field is computer vision and pattern recognition. The main research interests include human action and activity recognition, human attribute recognition, person re-identification, and large-scale person retrieval. Nowdays, the problem of alignment between machine learning and human values has been very essential for a safe, trusty and evolutionary human-machine collaboration system. Here is a [Chinese translation](https://t01z0iqrfjb.feishu.cn/drive/folder/M0q0fgzPvl7ZSRdakWPcUzAKnTc) on [The Alignment Problem](https://www.amazon.com/Alignment-Problem-Machine-Learning-Values/dp/0393635821) by BRIAN CHRISTIAN which is a comprehensive and insightful review on the AI history from the perspective of human-AI alignment. And our group also launch a new key R&D programme on human machine collaboration with the background of autonomous driving. Any discussions are welcome!

Based on previous studies on action recognition and attribute recognition, we design and develop a social location-based game, termed Love In Action (LIA), which gamifies public video cameras for forstering social relationships in real world. The game name is derived from a quote, "kindness is love in action." And the game aims to encourage individuals to express kindness towards others within their local community. Here is the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10449) and [video presentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OB4gOPcQ3GD_014ehFWf1Y6lErh1RAal/view?usp=sharing) of this work in [EAI ArtsIT 2024](https://artsit.eai-conferences.org/2024/).
